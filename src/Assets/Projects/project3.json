This helps us identify areas where our app can excel and differentiate itself.",

In the Plannee logo, I used a warm red-to-yellow gradient to convey energy,  fun, social connection, and quick planning, making it a great fit for a hangout planning app. It creates a welcoming and dynamic visual appeal. The paper plane symbolizes movement, communication, and seamless coordination—core values of the Plannee app. It visually represents the idea of sending plans effortlessly between friends, just like a paper plane flying from one person to another. In terms of typography, to make the app as easy to click and as simple as possible, I used a rounded and modern font choice, which reflects simplicity and minimalist. "
